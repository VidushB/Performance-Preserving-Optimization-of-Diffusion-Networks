On Google Colab, we showed the ability to AMP to significantly speed up model training times (around 0.6 iterations/second). 
And due to limitations from limited runtime and computation capabilities, it wasn't feasible to use on profiling and tracing.

Code has now been ported into HPC (NYU's Greene Supercomputer) for faster runtimes and using SBATCH commands to speed up compute times.
